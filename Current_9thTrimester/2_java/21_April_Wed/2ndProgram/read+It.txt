For windows : 

First and foremost after any error you fix
try to restart the tomcat and again compile the program and run it.

Tomcat has some buffer / cache issues . ( forgive him ).

To run This program you have to  place all the three files in different
directories 

1 : the jsp file in ROOT directory where ever you want 

2 : .tld File in WEB-INF  folder  ( not in classes or pack ) directly in 
    WEB-INF folder itself.

3 : The java file  in ROOT->WEB-INF->classes->pack->javaFile
    if you don't have WEB-INF directory then create all these directories  
    and then place the java file.

! don't forgot to compile the java file .

One more thing once you set the class path 

which is : 

set PATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_09\bin

place the above line directly in command prompt and run
( don't forgot to re-check the jdk version , which will be inside java directory in your program files and change accordingly in the class path )

now after setting the class path successfully  there's one more thing to do 
that is : 

jsp-api.jar 
which will be available in lib folder before ROOT directory .
You can either copy the address of file and use or directly copy that file in pack directory , where your java file exists.

once done  , to compile the program 

javac -cp ".;jsp-api.jar" javaFile.java

! if there is no jsp-api.jar file in your lib directory you can download it from the internet it's easy.

once compiled successfully .

now start the tomcat , run the jsp file which is in ROOT directory.





For Linux or Unix based operating the system it's almost same ::

The only difference is you don't have to mention  or set the class path  . And else the  compiling and other things are same. ( I suppose ) .
