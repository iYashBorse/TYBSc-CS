#copy paste the individual programs from here 
1 : to print addition of multiplication using hardcoded values 
2 : same using user Input 
3 : factorial of a number 

If you are using Cygwin then. Line spaces may cause you errors 
So ensure no line spaces are there try to copy paste  these codes using vim as text editor

Vim anyFileName.sh

Press 'i' to insert and copy paste

Press. Esc  then  shift + semicolon and then 'wq' to save and quite from vim

 
Bash fileName.sh

If you have any linux distribution ubuntu , openSUSE , run  the program in them  
(Won't face encoding errors like in Cygwin ) .  

PS : shell scripting is bit not so strict language 
     but some extra spaces may halt your day.


1: 


echo Using hardcoded values 
number1=1
number2=2 
number3=3
addition=$(($number1+$number2+$number3))
echo $addition
multiplication=$(($number1*$number2*$number3))
echo $multiplication



2: 


echo Enter the first number
read a
echo Enter the second number
read b
echo Enter the third number
read c
echo Enter the fourth number
read d
echo Enter the fifth number
read e
sum=$(($a+$b+$c+$d+$e))
sub=$(($a-$b))
mul=$(($a*$b*$c))
echo The addition of $a $b $c $d $e :: $sum
echo The Substraction is :: $sub
echo The Multiplication of $a  $b  $c is  :: $mul



3:

echo Factorial of a number 
echo "Enter a number to find factorial"
read number
factorial=1
for((i=2;i<=number;i++))
{
  factorial=$((factorial * i))
}
echo $factorial
