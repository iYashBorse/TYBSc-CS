Installation  is pretty straight forward 

Do next-next most of the time and at a place it will ask you to add a URL kinda something , at above there is a list of URLs  you can choose from or ADD  .

In that choose the third one in which " consant " keyword will  be there somewhere.


After installation simply  open the App icon where'ver it  have been created.

And that's it  you have your  UNIX like terminal working.



Few basic commands : 
// ignore the '$' symbol 


$whoami // who am I ?. System : Fool

$ls // list , it lists the files in the current directory you are in .

$cwd // displays  Current working directory you are in

$cd // Change directory 

$date // of Course _ it displays cartoon

$cal // calendar 

$mkdir giveAdirectoryName // it makes directory 

$rmdir AdirectoryNameToRemoveWhichIsAlreadyPresent  // it removes directory , remember  it will  only remove empty  directories 


$rm fileName   // to remove a file like .php .txt .exe et cetera .


$cat fileName // to display content's  of the files  like .java .php .txt in the terminal itself.


$touch filename.extension // to create a file like .php .txt .xml et cetera 


$open filename.extension // yes of Course it closes the file

$passwd  // https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/passwd.1.html  
 read the article in above link to understand the full working of this command.


$history // of course displays harappan civilization 

$exit // to exit


!!!!!! Warning  ~ 

// Try not to use such commands and keep your distance away from them 

rm -rf

Example  ( read to better understand ) ~ 

Assume you were working on something in Terminal in your home folder, and you remembered that your wife wanted you to remove something from her Documents folder. She no longer needed her Work Documents folder, as she had recently changed employers. Being the lazy efficient type of person that you are, you realize that you can do this directly from Terminal, without even changing directories. So you type:

sudo rm -rf /Users/spouse/Documents/Work Documents
(The -rf flags mean “recursively ( r ) traverse the folder, removing all files and sub-folders,” and “force ( f ) removal, ignoring permissions.” You’d have to use both these options, along with sudo, to remove a folder from another user’s directory.)

And there's no trash here ( it's just went like a wind from your system ).


PS : nothing personal and am not married. 



The Safest Solution

Short of not using rm at all, the next best solution is to always use rm -i. The -i option stands for interactive, and it forces you to manually accept each and every deletion. For instance, if you wanted to remove all the files with a name starting with “MyPic,” you’d do this:

	$ rm -i MyPic*
	remove MyPic1.jpg? y
	remove MyPic2.jpg? y
	remove MyPic3.jpg? y
	remove MyPic4.jpg? y
	
This is really the safest way to use rm, but it can get quite tedious—consider a directory with 150 files in it that you’d like to trash. There are, however, other solutions that provide some degree of safety. ( which i wont' be telling for now as it's just basics and you  have just learned the full-forms of ls and cd ( no offence )).

Bye.
